Once you are done writing the program, copy the main method in its entirety (not the class, just the main method) and paste it below.

Note: While this is a fictional conversation, Ada and Turing are giants in computing. Ada LovelaceLinks to an external site. is the first person to write an algorithm. She is the world's first programmer! Alan TuringLinks to an external site. is a pioneer in artificial intelligence and is known for creating the Turing Machine and the Turing TestLinks to an external site. (originally called imitation game) which tests whether a computer's intelligence is indistinguishable from that of a human.
